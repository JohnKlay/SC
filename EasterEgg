I know it's nothing amazing, as it's just a green page with some text, but at least you can say that you've got your very own page in this app, coded specifically for you. You can show other people if you'd like, just please not teachers. FYI I can update this page at any time from the internet including the title. Don't think this is permanent! If I get in trouble for this, it can be removed without an update to the app! Well, enjoy your easter egg!\n\nP.S. You can play games on https://mathplayground.com"
